# TransportApp

TransportApp is a web aplication written in python with Django framework.

## The aim of aplication

It is used to determine deliveries and preview delivery locations on the map.
Ultimately, the application should reduce delivery costs by visually suggesting a combination of shipping.


## How it works?
When order is added address is converted to geocode (lat, long) by using Google API.
We can see all 'new' deliveries on main page and go to the detail view were a single delivery is shown on map.
